A - 1 - set - $get_icons_from_web = true; - in your config
    2 - Make sure the img/icons directory is set to R/W (chmod 777) permission for webserver
    3 - If you still have problems, set proxy on /script/config.php
         $proxy_cfg['addr'] = '';
         $proxy_cfg['port'] = 80;
         $proxy_cfg['user'] = '';
         $proxy_cfg['pass'] = '';
    4 - Alternatively you can download and extract pre-cached icons (usually posted in our forums), extracting them into /img/icons directory.


Q - I cant send ingame mail, how can i fix that?
A - 1 - You need to set on /script/config.php
         $server[1]['telnet_port'] =  3443;  // Telnet port - Telnet settins are needed for sending InGame Mail.
         $server[1]['telnet_user'] = 'USER'; // Telnet username, must be all CAPS
         $server[1]['telnet_pass'] = 'pass'; // Telnet password
    2 - you need to enable and config RA in your mangos/trinity config
         Ra.Enabled = 1
         Ra.IP = 0.0.0.0
         Ra.Port = 3443
         Ra.MinLevel = 3
         Ra.Secure = 1


Q - *.php display just blank page, whats the matter?
A - 1 - Set debug to higher than 0 on your /script/config.php and you will see error
         $debug = 0; // 0 - no debug, only fatal errors.
                     // 1 - show total queries, mem usage, and only fatal errors.
                     // 2 - show total queries, mem usage, and all errors.
                     // 3 - show total queries, mem usage, all errors, and list of all global vars.
                     // 4 - show total queries, mem usage, all errors, list of all global vars, and values of all global vars.
    2 - go to example: http://adress_to_minimanager/bugreport.php
    3 - collect all info from 1 and 2 and make a detailed post on our forums.


Q - I use TrinityCore and some pages like ticket does not work properly, what should i do?
A - Set in your /script/config.php
     $server_type =  1; // 0=MaNGOS, 1=Trinity


Q - How do i setup more than one realm?
A - Follow sample from /script/config.dist.php and duplicate configs
     but remember $server[1] is to realm ID 1 - set on realmd DB, realmlist table
     so just check realm ID and set $server[2], $server[5], etc
